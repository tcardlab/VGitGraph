# Nuxt App (VGitGraph)

This repo utilizes Vue2 and pure SVG to generate collapsable git-like graphs.

## Going Forward

I would like to address some performance issues (both JS and inherent to SVG) as well as implement more generalizable data structures. 
For these reasons, I will likely start over with Vue3 and explore existing graphing libraries.
